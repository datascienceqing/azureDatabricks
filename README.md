I crawled the craigslist for couple of days to find the used Toyota car information.
This notebook is my analysis to figure out the average price and average price by year.

The biggest question is between the correlation of price to odometer reading and
to made-of-year, which one is stronger????
In other words, lowr odometer reading and recent model year, which one is more import
for a better resell price?
